The site where the data was obtained:

The data for the project: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
 
The data includes measurements for Triaxial acceleration and Triaxial Angular velocity.  The data also includes which activity the measurement was created from (Each person performed six activities - WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) and the data is collected from 30 volunteers.

The data is broken into 2 sets by the experimenters- training data and test data.  

The following data is read into the script:

- 'train/X_train.txt': Set of measurements from the "Training Group"

- 'train/y_train.txt': Set of activity labels from the "Training Group".

- 'test/X_test.txt': Set of measurements from the "Test Group"

- 'test/y_test.txt': Set of activity labels from the "Test Group".

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

For the purpose of this collection, training data and test data is combined.

--------------------------------------------------------

Script specifics:

jdata is the raw combined test and training measurements
jlabel is the raw combined test and training activity Ids
jsubject is the raw combined test and training volunteer Ids

featureNames is the specific measurements variables.  See specifics below which ties the variable names to their specific meanings.

actNames is the specific activity labels: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

meanstds is a logical vector of the variables which are means and standard deviation measurements.

datmeanstd is data frame of the raw data which are only means and standard deviation measurements.

Using datmeanstd create tidy data sets for the measurements by activity and by subject.

Measurements by Activity and labeled by its 'descriptive name' which is exactly the same name provided in the data is written out to file  "tidytxtbyactivity.txt"

Measurements by Subject and labeled by its "Volunteer Id" is written out to file "tidytxtbysubject.txt"
